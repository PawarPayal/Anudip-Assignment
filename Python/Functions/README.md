**Functions:**  
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.  
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.  
A function can return data as a result.  
**Creating a Function**
In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:  
Example:  
def my_function():  
  print("Hello from a function")  
  
**Calling a Function**  
To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis:  
Example:
def my_function():  
  print("Hello from a function")  
my_function()  

**Some Benefits of Using Functions**  
o Increase Code Readability   
o Increase Code Reusability
