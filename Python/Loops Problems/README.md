**For Loop**  
o For Loop allows us to iteerate through an list performing some action an each item in list.  
o A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).  
o This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method found in other object-orientated programming languages.   
o With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.  
o The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.  
o For loop allows you to apply the same operation to every item within loop. 
o Using For Loop avoid the need of manually managing the index.  
o For loop can iterate over any iterable object, such as dictionary, list or any custom iterators. 

**Python For Loop Syntax:**  
for var in iterable:  
    # statements  
       pass  
       
**Python For Loop with String**  
This code uses a for loop to iterate over a string and print each character on a new line.  
The loop assigns each character to the variable i and continues until all characters in the string have been processed.  

**Using range() with For Loop:**  
The range() function is commonly used with for loops to generate a sequence of numbers.  
It can take one, two, or three arguments:  
1)range(stop): Generates numbers from 0 to stop-1.  
2)range(start, stop): Generates numbers from start to stop-1.  
3)range(start, stop, step): Generates numbers from start to stop-1, incrementing by step.
