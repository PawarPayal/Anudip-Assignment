**NumPy**  
- Numerical Python  
- It is a Python Package  
- It consist of multidimensional array , objects and collection of routines for processing of array.
  
  **Syntax**  
  import numpy or  
  import numpy as np

  **Numpy array has following attributes:**  
  o ndarray.shape  
  o ndarray.ndim  
  o ndarray.dtype  
  o ndarray.size  
  o ndarray.astype

  **Why Numpy ?**  
  Numpy data structures perform in:  
  1)Memory:Numpy data structure takes up less space.  
  2)Performance:they have need for speed and are faster than lists.  
  3)Functionality:Scipy and numpy have optimized functions such as linear algebra .
