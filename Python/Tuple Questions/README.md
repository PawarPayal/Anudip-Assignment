 **How to create a tuple?**  
 
A tuple can be created by enclosing the values with a pair of brackets and separated by commas for instance:  
Let us create a tuple called "tuple", and put in some values including both string and integer data this can be done as shown below:  


# Creating a tuple and storing the values  
tuple = ("Today's", "Date", "Is", 15, "August", 2019)
print(tuple)  
("Today's", 'Date', 'Is', 15, 'August', 2019)  
print(type(tuple))  
<class 'tuple'>
